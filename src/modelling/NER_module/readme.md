#### About pkl files 
in order to use ***Word2Vec*** or ***your data files*** you need to parse them once then save the objects in pkl format (so you do not need parse them each time you need them)
so when addressing Word2Vec file in program *you need to address the .pkl file*
and when addressing data files in program you *need to address directory of .pkl files* (x,y,dict,dict_rev,..)
